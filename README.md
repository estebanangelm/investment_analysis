Put some information about your data science project! I recommend you a structure:

## Problem

In a couple of sentences write the problem you're trying to solve using data.

## Hypothesis

State your main hypothesis.

## Requirements

Explain the technical requirements the user cloning your repository needs for reproducing the project.

## Data Sources

There's a directory just for data sources, but it's important to have a summary table with the main ones:

| File Name | Address | Description |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |
